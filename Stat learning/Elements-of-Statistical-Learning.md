# Elements of Statistical Learning
The following are my notes from [Elements of statistical learning](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/NoHesitations/BookAdvanced.pdf).
First of all, it should be noted that I relied on Max Dama's [recommendations on most useful chapters of the book](https://blog.headlandstech.com/2022/02/16/elements-of-statistical-learning-8-10/) (I was lucky enough to have a conversation with him). 
Next, it should be noted that at the time of writing these notes, I'm still a novice in AI(which isn't hopefully the case by the time you're reading this), and so, directly approaching ESL wouldn't allow me to fully benefit from it, and this is why I started with another useful book for the same purpose (more elementary but with lesser depth) -- [Introduction to Statistical learning](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~rabbee/s154/ISLR_First_Printing.pdf), these notes also go through a few of its chapters, especially at the beguinning (I'll make sure to always say which is which).
To summerize, I will start with ISL and then switch to ESL once I feel like I have a sufficient mastery of the necessary topics.

## Chapter I
Supervised learning is when we have an outcome variable to 'guide the learning process', thus we compare our model's result $\hat y$ to some desired result $y$.
Unsupervised learning on the otherside, our task is to describe how the data is organized/clustered.
